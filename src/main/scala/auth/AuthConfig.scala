/** Configuration for JWT access-token validation.
  *
  * Defaults are deliberately strict, as appropriate for a fintech API:
  *   - only asymmetric signature algorithms are accepted (no HMAC, and `alg: none` is structurally impossible because
  *     only signed JWTs are parsed)
  *   - issuer and audience are always verified exactly
  *   - `sub`, `exp` and `iat` are required claims
  *
  * @param issuer
  *   expected `iss` claim, matched exactly (e.g. `https://auth.example.com`)
  * @param audience
  *   identifier of this API; the token's `aud` list must contain it
  * @param jwksUri
  *   HTTPS URL of the authorization server's JWK set
  * @param allowedAlgorithms
  *   permitted JWS algorithms; keep this to the algorithms your authorization server actually uses
  * @param acceptedTokenTypes
  *   permitted JOSE `typ` header values. RFC 9068 access tokens use `at+jwt`; plain `JWT` (or an absent `typ`) is
  *   accepted by default for compatibility. Restrict to `at+jwt` only if your issuer supports it, to rule out ID-token
  *   replay at the API.
  * @param clockSkew
  *   tolerated clock difference when checking `exp` / `nbf` / `iat`
  * @param requiredClaims
  *   claims that must be present for the token to be accepted
  * @param requireTokenId
  *   if true, tokens without a `jti` claim are rejected; enable this when using a revocation denylist
  * @param maxTokenLength
  *   hard upper bound on the compact JWT length, to bound parsing work
  * @param jwksCacheTtl
  *   how long fetched JWKS documents are cached
  * @param jwksRefreshTimeout
  *   how long a cache refresh may take before the cached set is reused
  * @param jwksOutageTtl
  *   how long previously fetched (public) keys may continue to be used if the JWKS endpoint is down; after this,
  *   validation fails closed
  * @param httpConnectTimeout
  *   connect timeout for JWKS retrieval
  * @param httpReadTimeout
  *   read timeout for JWKS retrieval
  * @param jwksSizeLimitBytes
  *   maximum accepted size of the JWKS document
